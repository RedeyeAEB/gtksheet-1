Basic Installation
==================

One way to compile this package is using GNU autotools:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code 
     and type the following commands to configure the package 
     for your system.

     `autoreconf -f -i'
     `./configure'

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

  Run `./configure --help' to get a list of build options.

You can alternatively use meson (https://mesonbuild.com)
to build GtkSheet on Linux:

  1. meson setup .Linux.3.x86_64
  2. ninja-build -C .Linux.3.x86_64


For cross-compilation on CentOS7 for MinGW 32/64Bit, you can use:

  1. meson setup .MinGW.32x --cross-file=cross/centos7_mingw32.txt 
  2. ninja-build -C .MinGW.32x

  1. meson setup .MinGW.64x --cross-file=cross/centos7_mingw64.txt 
  2. ninja-build -C .MinGW.64x 

After meson setup, you can run `meson configure <builddir>' 
to get a list of build options. Or look at the file
meson_options.txt in the source base directory.
