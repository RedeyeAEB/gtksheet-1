- Properties for GtkSheet

- Child properties for GtkSheet

- GtkItemEntry uses GtkEntry struct members directly, which is deprecated, as
  in Gtk+ 3.0 this will not be allowed.

- Proper python bindings

- Implement GtkBuildable interface for GtkSheet. This will make possible
  to build GtkSheet from a GtkBuilder XML file.
