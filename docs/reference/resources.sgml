    <title>Filing a bug report or feature request</title>

    <para>
If you encounter a bug, misfeature, or missing feature in GTK+, please
file a bug report on 
      <ulink 
        url="https://github.com/fpaquet/gtksheet/issues">https://github.com/fpaquet/gtksheet/issues</ulink>. 
We'd also appreciate any support for fixing incomplete or misleading information in the GtkSheet documentation.
    </para>

    <para>
Don't hesitate to file a bug report, even if you think we may know
about it already, or aren't sure of the details. Just give us as much
information as you have, and if it's already fixed or has already been
discussed, we'll add a note to that effect in the report.
